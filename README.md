# Incorporating small-scale forest disturbance in aboveground biomass estimates of tropical mountains

Code for analyzing the effect of recent land use on forest structure and aboveground biomass (AGB) in Tropical Montane Cloud Forest using Landsat time series and forest inventory data.
This repository contains:
* code for organizing raw data from the input directory and saved in the output directory
* code for analyzing data stored in the output directory
* code for reproducing figures in the manuscript

Files in the input and output directory are too large and will not be uploaded to this repository, instead they'll be deposited in Dryad.
